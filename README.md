# Substack2Markdown

Substack2Markdown is a Python tool for downloading free and premium Substack posts and saving them as both Markdown and HTML files. It also generates a simple HTML interface that lets you browse and sort through the posts. Premium content is saved as long as you're subscribed to the Substack.

üÜï @Firevvork has also built a web version of this tool at **Substack Reader** ‚Äì no installation required! (Works for free Substacks only.)

## Substack2Markdown Interface

When you run the script, it creates a folder (named after the Substack) in `/substack_md_files` and then begins scraping the specified Substack URL, converting blog posts into Markdown files. After saving all posts, it generates an HTML file in the `/substack_html_pages` directory to browse the posts.

You can either hardcode the Substack URL and the number of posts you‚Äôd like to save at the top of the file or specify them as command‚Äëline arguments.

## New Changes in This Fork

- **Manual Login for Premium Scraping:**  
  The premium scraper now launches Chrome and prompts you to log in manually. Once you‚Äôve logged in (by clicking the magic link or entering a code), you simply hit Enter in the terminal to continue with the scraping process.

- **Switched to Chrome WebDriver:**  
  The tool now uses Chrome‚Äôs WebDriver (via webdriver-manager‚Äôs ChromeDriverManager) instead of Microsoft Edge for better compatibility.

- **Configurable Request Delay:**  
  A new command‚Äëline argument (`--delay`) allows you to set a delay (in seconds) between requests. This helps avoid ‚Äútoo many requests‚Äù errors and reduces the load on Substack‚Äôs servers.

- **Improved Session Handling and Explicit Waits:**  
  The code now uses Selenium‚Äôs explicit waits (via WebDriverWait and expected conditions) to wait for key elements. It also handles session expiration by prompting for re‚Äëlogin when necessary.
